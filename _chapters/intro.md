In one sentence, this book is about:

> A guide to help independent consultants and freelancers build a sustainable, practice that suits their unique personality, skills and goals.

Importantly, this is NOT a "how to" guide. A lot of what you read is not even wrong, doesn't help you with the real questions and is too proscriptive. It tells you what to do, instead of helping you figure out what to do.

Because every independent consultant is unique. Everyone's biases are uni

There are three core ideas: interdependence, lightness and introspection.

## 1. Interdependence

Your long term success as an indie consultant depends on building your network, being sustainably visible in your network and finding peers and support network along the way.

## 2. The Fool

Doing effective client work requires stepping into the role of the fool: someone capable of surprise, improvisation and speaking truth to power in the high court of politics that is your client's organization.

Changing organizations, i.e. doing **effective** consulting work requires a lightness of touch, a keen sense of the political context for your work.

## 3. The Inner Game

The most common cause of failure for independent consultants is not generating enough clients. The second most common cause of failure is building a profitable consulting machine that you don't enjoy running. Trapping yourself in a bad position.

To navigate a sustainable, rewarding, interesting consulting practice you need to be able to navigate your own biases around the kind of work you want to do, and managing your own personal energy levels to be able to find the right work/life balance. To craft an identity that you're comfortable with.

## A City of Fools

My ambition with this book is nothing more than building a city of fools. To help independents build long term sustainable rewarding practices. I hope you enjoy.
