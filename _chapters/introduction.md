In 2015 the New York Times tweeted out a pea-based recipe for Guacamole and all hell broke loose. Before the week was out, the Texas GOP was saying "The @nytimes declared war on Texas when they suggested adding green peas to guacamole." and even Barak Obama was “Respect the NYT but not buying peas in guac."

What would later become known as "peagate" was a classic mid 2010s classic social media firestorm.

And maybe it was a little, tiny bit my fault?

Rewind the clock to one year before - it's 2014, the New York Times had a guacamole problem and they'd hired me to help. I was sat in a large meeting room, walls covered in post-its and page designs printed on the wall, presenting to the NYT Cooking team. I was there to help with their SEO problems.

On the other side of the table sat Sam Sifton, a charismatic beaming enthusiastic figure and also a long-time editor of 20+ years at the New York Times. Sam didn't know much about SEO b but was willing to engage. I was trying to explain the guacamole problem in plain language:

> "The problem is that you have 26 guacamole recipes - and they all say "guacamole recipe" on them. When someone searches in Google for "guacamole recipe" which one should they land on? Which one is best? And how do we differentiate the other 25?"

This project was my second freelance consulting project since I quit my job and I was feeling incredibly fortunate and frustrated at the same time. On the one hand I was sat inside a magnificent building (you know what Times Square is named after right?), working for an amazing brand - the kind of brand you aspire towards working with, and it was only my second freelance client!

On the other hand - the work was firmly SEO work, and I was viewed as the "SEO consultant" in the room. Yes, the kind of work I knew very well but not the kind of work that I had dreams and aspirations towards.

What rarely gets mentioned as part of the great pea-guacamole debacle was the followup tweet. The NYTimes shared a link to a Guacamole collections page - listing out some of the best Guacamole recipes, with an editors pick recipe clearly marked and several sub-styles (like Tomatillo Guacamole, Guacamole de Frutas, Suvir Saran’s Guacamole With Toasted Cumin, Italian Guacamole and yes, Green Pea Guacamole). This was almost exactly as I'd recommended as part of my work with the team - shining a light on the best canonical Guacamole recipe, while also differentiating the other recipes.

One of the hard things about consulting is that "simple" recommendations rarely prove to be simple. This NYT project was no different - I was feeling pretty good after managing to explain the problem with their taxonomy and tagging structure in a way that Sam Sifton would understand. But it turns out that diagnosing the problem was simply the first step in a long, complicated journey.

As the meeting was wrapping up Ben French, then Executive Director, New Products, pulled me aside and confided that while he agreed that the guacamole problem was a real problem - the NYT Cooking team had just spent a ton of time and cost on re-tagging every single recipe. Going through that process again felt insurmountable both from a cost perspective, but also an internal political perspective - it would make them look stupid to have to go back and ask for more money to re-do work they'd just done.

We'd have to find another way.

These kind of p




Part of the consulting engagement with the NYTimes involved a recommendation to update their tagging ability - they were going to need the ability to group all their recipes together like "thanksgiving recipes" or "gluten free recipes". While floating this idea to the team it emerged that as part of their initial launch (which was still in recent memory) the team had engaged in a complete re-tagging of their recipe archive. So re-re-tagging their recipes was going to be a tough sell internally...

This is the part of any client engagement that gets me excited - where you realize that there's a real texture to a client's problems. There's no simple "re-tagging" project - it's a mixture of internal politics, creative ideation and maneuvering to help the client find a version of the project that will be effective AND get buy-in internally to be able to be implemented.

## 6 Years Later...

I'd come back to work with the New York Times 6 years later in my consulting journey - this time doing an entirely new kind of work: advising a senior executive on their internal status and influence and partnering on them with a sample project which was an innovation sprint to design a new product for the Times.

That journey is the same one I want you to go on reading this book - not just "generating clients" though of course that's part of it - but doing it on your own terms, finding the kind of work that lights you up so that you can sustain your freelancing and consulting career.

The first time I was brought in to work with the New York Times it was via my friend John. His friend Hannah worked at the New York Times and she was asking around for a recommendation. John, a close friend of mine and someone I used to work with put my name forward.

6 years later I'd come back to work with the Times via a friend Dorothy - someone I'd actually interviewed with back in 2013 (over 7 years previously!).

This story encapsulates all the themes of the book - how clients come through your network, why changing clients is hard and requires delicate work, and how your personal narrative and identity is a key component of your success.

## About Me

My background - what I bring to the table. I've been doing some form of "consulting" work since 2007. First helping launch an SEO agency - I ran the consulting part of the business, first doing the work myself, then managing a team of consultants working on client work. Later I'd join Google and work with the Creative Lab and BizOps teams - straddling various forms of intrapreneurship - effectively consulting with various teams and projects across the business (including designing presentations for Sundar who would go on to become Google's CEO).

Since 2014 I've been an independent consultant - 

I found that writing about independent consulting was generative and useful for me personally, that people liked it and that a lot of my best advice ran counter to some of the accepted wisdom. Hence this book.

## The Three Themes of the Book

Interdependent Networks, Clients as systems and the inner game of consulting

### 1. Interdependent Networks

From independence to interdependence. The first few chapters look at how generating clients is truly a function of your network - and that networks have some surprising properties (like you're statistically likely to have fewer friends than your friends)

Chapter 2: strange attraction
Chapter 3: weak ties and strong intros
Chapter 4: rejecting specialization

How to generate clients, how to reconcile the idea of "positioning" that is typically hard for indie consultants.

### 2. Improv as a tool to change clients

Changing clients is hard. They're primed to reject change, they're designed to be stable systems. As an outsider we need to first understand the real reason we're there and then find surprising ways to effect change.

The archetype of the fool helps us 

### 3. The inner game of consulting

In this section we address some of the causes of burn out: energy management, overwork, and identity.


## New Ways of Thinking - not a "How To"

If you read any advice on how to be a consultant you'll get a lot of prescriptive mandates - "You should.." and "This is how to.." - you won't find much of that in this book. One thing I've realized is that there are as many approaches as there are independent consultants. Everyone is unique and the only way to truly build a sustainable approach to independent consulting is to match your approach to your own personal biases.

That's why this book is called The Consultant's Grain - your own unique ideas, perspective, and yes your flaws - they all play a part of making your own unique practice.






People end up independent for all sorts of reasons - being laid off, choosing to be your own boss, health issues. But the 

The idea of independence is appealing - to be your own boss, to be able to take long vacations.

But the idea of client work is intimidating. Clients are demanding, stressful, and, yes hard work.

When I set out as an independent consultant a lot of the advice and writing that I consumed seemed designed to embrace the independent part, but to trivialize or reduce the client part. It was all about skipping that step - trying to reach financial independnece without relying on client work.

That's why so much of the literature pushed you towards making courses, selling downloads, hiring freelancers. This is... fine? But in my experience a lot of the 

"Consultant" is a loaded term. "Strategy" is a loaded term.

But consulting work in it's raw form can be a powerful force. Yes it's client work. Yes it's exchanging time for money. But I want to reclaim the idea of consulting.

It's exchanging time for (a lot) of money. Doing work that is intellectually stimulating and interesting.

This is a kind of cash and calendar freedom that is rarely talked about. Am I lounging on the beach all day long? No. Do I take long bike rides on a tuesday morning and take long vacations in teh summer? Yes. Am I free to do whatever I want? No. Am I around for the kids when they need me? Yes.

This book isn't about escaping a job - it's about architecting the best job you ever had. Where you work on interesting, well-paid work, on your own terms, with plenty of free time.

Cash and calendar freedom.

The highlights of my own journey:
