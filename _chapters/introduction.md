In 2015 the New York Times tweeted out a pea-based recipe for Guacamole and all hell broke loose. Before the week was out, the Texas GOP was saying "The @nytimes declared war on Texas when they suggested adding green peas to guacamole." and even Barak Obama was “Respect the NYT but not buying peas in guac."

What would later become known as "peagate" was a classic mid 2010s classic social media firestorm.

And maybe it was a little, tiny bit my fault?

Rewind the clock to one year before - it's 2014, the New York Times had a guacamole problem and I was there to help. I was sat in a large meeting room, walls covered in post-its and page designs printed on the wall, presenting to the NYT Cooking team. I was there to help with their SEO problems.

On the other side of the table sat Sam Sifton, a charismatic beaming enthusiastic figure and also a long-time editor of 20+ years at the New York Times. Sam didn't know much about SEO b but was willing to engage. I was trying to explain the guacamole problem in plain language:

> "The problem is that you have 26 guacamole recipes - and they all say "guacamole recipe" on them. When someone searches in Google for "guacamole recipe" which one should they land on? Which one is best? And how do we differentiate the other 25?"

This project was my second freelance consulting project since I quit my job and I was feeling incredibly fortunate and frustrated at the same time. On the one hand I was sat inside a magnificent building (you know what Times Square is named after right?), working for an amazing brand - the kind of brand you aspire towards working with, and it was only my second freelance client!

On the other hand - the work was firmly SEO work, and I was viewed as the "SEO consultant" in the room. Yes, the kind of work I knew very well but not the kind of work that I had dreams and aspirations towards.

What rarely gets mentioned as part of the great pea-guacamole debacle was the followup tweet. The NYTimes shared a link to a Guacamole collections page - listing out some of the best Guacamole recipes, with an editors pick recipe clearly marked and several sub-styles (like Tomatillo Guacamole, Guacamole de Frutas, Suvir Saran’s Guacamole With Toasted Cumin, Italian Guacamole and yes, Green Pea Guacamole). This was almost exactly as I'd recommended as part of my work with the team - shining a light on the best canonical Guacamole recipe, while also differentiating the other recipes.

Part of the consulting engagement with the NYTimes involved a recommendation to update their tagging ability - they were going to need the ability to group all their recipes together like "thanksgiving recipes" or "gluten free recipes". While floating this idea to the team it emerged that as part of their initial launch (which was still in recent memory) the team had engaged in a complete re-tagging of their recipe archive. So re-re-tagging their recipes was going to be a tough sell internally...

This is the part of any client engagement that gets me excited - where you realize that there's a real texture to a client's problems. There's no simple "re-tagging" project - it's a mixture of internal politics, creative ideation and maneuvering to help the client find a version of the project that will be effective AND get buy-in internally to be able to be implemented.

I'd come back to work with the New York Times 6 years later in my consulting journey - this time doing an entirely new kind of work: advising a senior executive on their internal status and influence and partnering on them with a sample project which was an innovation sprint to design a new product for the Times.

That journey is the same one I want you to go on reading this book - not just "generating clients" though of course that's part of it - but doing it on your own terms, finding the kind of work that lights you up so that you can sustain your freelancing and consulting career.

The first time I was brought in to work with the New York Times it was via my friend John. His friend Hannah worked at the New York Times and she was asking around for a recommendation. John, a close friend of mine and someone I used to work with put my name forward.

6 years later I'd come back to work with the Times via a friend Dorothy - someone I'd actually interviewed with back in 2013 (over 7 years previously!).

This story encapsulates all the themes of the book - how clients come through your network, why changing clients is hard and requires delicate work, and how your personal narrative and identity is a key component of your success.

## The Three Themes of the Book

Interdependent Networks, Clients as systems and the inner game of consulting

### 1. Interdependent Networks

From independence to interdependence. The first few chapters look at how generating clients is truly a function of your network - and that networks have some surprising properties (like you're statistically likely to have fewer friends than your friends)

Chapter 2: strange attraction
Chapter 3: weak ties and strong intros
Chapter 4: rejecting specialization

How to generate clients, how to reconcile the idea of "positioning" that is typically hard for indie consultants.

### 2. Improv as a tool to change clients

Changing clients is hard. They're primed to reject change, they're designed to be stable systems. As an outsider we need to first understand the real reason we're there and then find surprising ways to effect change.

The archetype of the fool helps us 

### 3. The inner game of consulting

In this section we address some of the causes of burn out: energy management, overwork, and identity.





I don't think peagate was my fault exactly, in the same way the butterfly has a hard time feeling responsible for the tornado in Tokyo. But perhaps I was

The NYTimes had a guacamole problem and I was there to help. 



In 2015 the New York Times was in trouble. They were getting called out for "cancelling avocados" and flamed for "idiot ideas about guacamole". All of this might have been a little bit my fault.

You see, a year earlier the New York Times had a guacamole problem and had called me to help.



Of course, it wasn't a real guacamole crisis - it was an SEO project with the NYT Cooking team - but I was explaining to Sam Sifton, a charismatic, senior and exceedling accomplished editor at the NYT why SEO was important and why there were problems.

"You've got 26 guacamole recipes you see, and only 

(A year later the NYTimes would get involved in "peagate" a huge social media controversey )

One of my very first freelance clients was the New York Times - more specifically the NYT Cooking team. They had some SEO problems they wanted to work through and had reached out to me.

The email from Hannah at the NYTimes read: "John suggested that I speak with you, and my preference would be to connect the team with an independent consultant over a larger agency." 

This vingnette really represents the story of the book. How to find work through your network, why doing consulting work is more than just "giving advice" and why our personal identities are so entwined in the work.

The book has three sections:

Part 1: Going Independent & Finding Work (leaping)

Part 2: Doing the work (systems, ways of seeing, improv)

Part 3: Managing time, energy and identity (the inner game)



- identity, coming back 6 years later to do more interesting work.
- explaining the work to Sam Sifton
- navigating the work and "the work" - tagging thousands of recipes
- getting the work via John

Feeling insignificant. Buried inside the hallways of a great institution. But talking about... guacamole seo?

Part of the problem of course was 

Interdependence, Improv and Identity.

Explaining to Sam Sifton, a long time journalist, editor and food critic about how SEO works and why they should care. "You have 26 guacamole recipes. When someone searches for "guacamole recipe" in Google, which one do you want them to land on?"

While The New York Times is a great brand for one of my first freelance gigs, it was more than a little soul crushing. After spending a decade+ in SEO this engagment felt entirely transactional - not that *interesting* to me.

I'd be back 6 years later to do some more consulting work - this time on my own terms as an independent consultant. Advising a new executive and support a new product R&D sprint. Nothing to do with SEO, far more stimulating and engaging. And, ironically, still working with Sam Sifton!






It turns out that they had already

and I was there to help. One of my very first client projects working for myself was the NYTimes Cooking team. They had some SEO problems  - like the fact that they had 26 Guacamole recipes that all looked the same to Google - and I was working with them to help.

A story about clients, about interdependence.  


I need a human story. Personal or celebrity. Some narrative that pulls the reader in.
Then this leads into "a lesson" that encapsulates the idea of the story and the themes of the book.






People end up independent for all sorts of reasons - being laid off, choosing to be your own boss, health issues. But the 

The idea of independence is appealing - to be your own boss, to be able to take long vacations.

But the idea of client work is intimidating. Clients are demanding, stressful, and, yes hard work.

When I set out as an independent consultant a lot of the advice and writing that I consumed seemed designed to embrace the independent part, but to trivialize or reduce the client part. It was all about skipping that step - trying to reach financial independnece without relying on client work.

That's why so much of the literature pushed you towards making courses, selling downloads, hiring freelancers. This is... fine? But in my experience a lot of the 

"Consultant" is a loaded term. "Strategy" is a loaded term.

But consulting work in it's raw form can be a powerful force. Yes it's client work. Yes it's exchanging time for money. But I want to reclaim the idea of consulting.

It's exchanging time for (a lot) of money. Doing work that is intellectually stimulating and interesting.

This is a kind of cash and calendar freedom that is rarely talked about. Am I lounging on the beach all day long? No. Do I take long bike rides on a tuesday morning and take long vacations in teh summer? Yes. Am I free to do whatever I want? No. Am I around for the kids when they need me? Yes.

This book isn't about escaping a job - it's about architecting the best job you ever had. Where you work on interesting, well-paid work, on your own terms, with plenty of free time.

Cash and calendar freedom.

The Google offices are about as amazing as you've been led to believe. Bright and airy, colorful walls, snacks to die and massages during the day. The cubicles where you go to take video calls were often the same ones I used to cry in during the day. I felt trapped and suffocated. Lost deep inside the machine and feeling like I lacked any kind of autonomy, purpose or challenging work - combined with a visa that meant I couldn't easily quit was an awful psychological place to be.

Which is why as soon as my Green Card arrived I quit.

The moment you become "independent" is different for everyone. Sometimes it's a raw inability to work for someone else. Sometimes you're laid off and forced into the path.

However you do it though, it's always a mixture of horror and joy. Freedom is intoxicating.

The highlights of my own journey:

* October 2014: Quit my job, with ambitions to work on an art startup with my life partner. 
* February 2015: After several months of juggling "startup" life alongside a little bit of freelancing and consulting, the realization is that consulting work is easier money than selling art, and I actually enjoy it quite a bit.
* April 2016: Realize that
